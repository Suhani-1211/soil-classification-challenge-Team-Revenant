# Soil Classification Hackathon Challenge Template Repository


##Setup Instructions
##Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soil-classification.git
cd soil-classification
##Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If youâ€™re on Kaggle, you can skip this step â€” Kaggle notebooks already include many dependencies (like torch, albumentations, and timm).

ðŸ§ª Dataset
Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train.csv         # image_id, label
â”œâ”€â”€ test.csv          # image_id
â””â”€â”€ images/           # All .jpg images used in both train & test
Update file paths in the code if needed.

# Run Instructions
## Locally (Jupyter or Python Script)
To train the model locally:
python train.py
To run inference on the test set:
python test.py
Youâ€™ll get a submission.csv file with predictions.

## On Kaggle (Notebook Workflow)
Go to Kaggle Notebooks.

Create a new notebook.

Upload:

train.py

test.py

soil_dataset.py

Your data/ folder (train.csv, test.csv, and images)

Install any additional libraries if needed:

!pip install timm albumentations
Run the cells to train and generate predictions.

## Output
After training:

Best model is saved as: best_soil_model.pth

Final submission file: submission.csv

##Evaluation Metric
We use macro F1-score for validation performance tracking and best model selection.
